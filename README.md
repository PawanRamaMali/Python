# Python

* Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language.
* Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. 
* Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected.
* It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.
* It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

## Python statements and control flow

Python's statements include (among others):

* The assignment statement, using a single equals sign `=`.
* The `if` statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of else-if).
* The `for` statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block.
* The `while` statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true.
* The `try` statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses; it also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block will always be run regardless of how the block exits.
* The `raise` statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception.
* The `class` statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object-oriented programming.
* The `def` statement, which defines a function or method.
* The `with` statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a file and then closing it), allowing resource-acquisition-is-initialization (RAII)-like behavior and replaces a common try/finally idiom.
* The `break` statement, exits from a loop.
* The `continue` statement, skips this iteration and continues with the next item.
* The `del` statement, removes a variable, which means the reference from the name to the value is deleted and trying to use that variable will cause an error. A deleted variable can be reassigned.
* The `pass` statement, which serves as a NOP. It is syntactically needed to create an empty code block.
* The `assert` statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that should apply.
* The `yield` statement, which returns a value from a generator function and yield is also an operator. This form is used to implement coroutines.
* The `return` statement, used to return a value from a function.
* The `import` statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program.
