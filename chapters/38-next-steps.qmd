print(arr.mean())  # 3.0
print(arr.std())   # 1.41...

# Matrix operations
matrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
print(matrix.T)  # Transpose
print(np.linalg.inv(matrix))  # Inverse
```

### Pandas - Data Analysis

```python
import pandas as pd

# DataFrames
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
    'age': [25, 30, 35],
    'salary': [50000, 60000, 70000]
})

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Line plot
plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 4, 9, 16])
plt.xlabel('X axis')
plt.ylabel('Y axis')
plt.title('Simple Plot')
plt.show()

# Seaborn for beautiful plots

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
```

### File Automation

```python
from pathlib import Path
import shutil
from datetime import datetime

def organize_downloads():
    """Organize downloads folder by file type"""
    downloads = Path.home() / 'Downloads'

    for file in downloads.iterdir():
        if file.is_file():
            # Create folder for extension
            ext = file.suffix[1:] or 'no_extension'
            folder = downloads / ext
            folder.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

            # Move file
            shutil.move(str(file), str(folder / file.name))

def backup_important_files():
    """Create dated backup of important files"""
    source = Path.home() / 'Documents' / 'Important'
    backup_name = f"backup_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d')}"
    backup_path = Path.home() / 'Backups' / backup_name

    shutil.copytree(source, backup_path)
```

### Web Scraping

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def scrape_news(url):
    """Scrape news headlines"""
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

    headlines = []
    for heading in soup.find_all('h2', class_='headline'):
        headlines.append(heading.text.strip())

    return headlines
```

### Email Automation

```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart

def send_report_email(recipient, subject, body):
    """Send automated email report"""
    msg = MIMEMultipart()
    msg['From'] = 'your@email.com'
    msg['To'] = recipient
    msg['Subject'] = subject

    msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'html'))

    with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587) as server:
        server.starttls()
        server.login('your@email.com', 'password')
        server.send_message(msg)
```
