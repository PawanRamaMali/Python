# Your First Python Program

## The Classic "Hello, World!"

Every programmer's journey begins with "Hello, World!" - a tradition dating back to 1974. Let's start yours!

```{python}
print("Hello, World!")
```

Congratulations! You're now a Python programmer! 🎉

## Understanding Your First Program

Let's break down what just happened:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

- `print` is a **function** that displays output
- `()` are **parentheses** that contain the function's arguments
- `"Hello, World!"` is a **string** (text) we want to display
- The string is wrapped in **quotes** (can use `"` or `'`)

## Making It More Interesting

Let's expand our program:

```{python}
print("Hello, World!")
print("My name is Python")
print("I was created in 1991")
print("I'm here to help you learn programming!")
```

:::{.callout-note}
## Key Insight

Each `print()` statement outputs on a new line automatically.
:::

## Working with Different Quotes

Python accepts both single and double quotes for strings:

```{python}
print("Double quotes work")
print('Single quotes work too')
print("It doesn't matter which you choose")
print('But be consistent!')
```

When do you need one over the other?

```{python}
# Use double quotes when your string contains single quotes
print("It's a beautiful day!")

# Use single quotes when your string contains double quotes
print('She said, "Hello!"')

# Or use triple quotes for multi-line strings
print("""This is a
multi-line
string!""")
```

## Comments: Talking to Humans

Comments are notes in your code that Python ignores. They're for humans reading your code (including future you!).

```{python}
# This is a single-line comment
print("Hello!")  # You can also comment at the end of a line

# Comments are great for explaining WHY you're doing something
# Use them liberally!

"""
This is a multi-line comment
(technically a multi-line string that's not assigned to anything)
You can write as much as you want here
"""
print("Comments help make code readable")
```

:::{.callout-tip}
## Comment Best Practices

- Explain **why**, not **what** (code shows what)
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Don't over-comment obvious things
- Use comments to mark TODO items or explain complex logic
:::

## Printing Multiple Items

You can print multiple things at once:

```{python}
print("Hello", "World", "from", "Python")
```

Notice the automatic spaces between items.

You can change the separator:

```{python}
print("Hello", "World", sep="-")
print("2025", "01", "15", sep="/")
print("Python", "is", "fun", sep="")
```

And control the ending:

```{python}
print("Hello", end=" ")
print("World")  # Continues on same line

print("Line 1", end="***")
print("Line 2")
```

## Doing Math in Python

Python is also a powerful calculator:

```{python}
# Basic arithmetic
print(2 + 2)        # Addition
print(10 - 3)       # Subtraction
print(4 * 5)        # Multiplication
print(20 / 4)       # Division (always gives float)
print(20 // 4)      # Floor division (integer result)
print(17 % 5)       # Modulo (remainder)
print(2 ** 8)       # Exponentiation (power)
```

You can combine operations:

```{python}
print(2 + 3 * 4)          # Multiplication first
print((2 + 3) * 4)        # Parentheses change order
print(10 + 5 * 2 - 3)     # Multiple operations
```

:::{.callout-note}
## Order of Operations

Python follows PEMDAS:
- **P**arentheses
- **E**xponents
- **M**ultiplication/**D**ivision (left to right)
- **A**ddition/**S**ubtraction (left to right)
:::

## Mixing Text and Numbers

You can't directly mix strings and numbers:

```{python}
#| error: true
# This causes an error:
print("I have " + 5 + " apples")
```

But there are several solutions:

### Solution 1: Convert to String

```{python}
print("I have " + str(5) + " apples")
```

### Solution 2: Use Commas

```{python}
print("I have", 5, "apples")
```

### Solution 3: F-strings (Best! Introduced in Python 3.6)

```{python}
apples = 5
print(f"I have {apples} apples")
print(f"2 + 2 = {2 + 2}")
print(f"Python is {2025 - 1991} years old in 2025")
```

F-strings are powerful! You can put any expression inside `{}`:

```{python}
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(f"My name is {name} and I'm {age} years old")
print(f"Next year I'll be {age + 1}")
print(f"{name.upper()} likes Python")
```

## Creating a Complete Program

Let's combine everything to create a more substantial program:

```{python}
# My First Python Program
# Author: Your Name
# Date: 2025

print("=" * 40)  # Print 40 equals signs
print("Welcome to My First Python Program!")
print("=" * 40)

# Personal Information
name = "Alice"
age = 25
city = "New York"

# Display information
print(f"\nHello! My name is {name}.")
print(f"I am {age} years old.")
print(f"I live in {city}.")

# Some calculations
print(f"\nIn 5 years, I'll be {age + 5} years old.")
print(f"I was born in {2025 - age}.")

# Fun fact
print(f"\n{name} loves Python programming!")
print("\n" + "=" * 40)
print("Thanks for running my program!")
print("=" * 40)
```

## Special Characters in Strings

Python has special character sequences that start with backslash `\`:

```{python}
# Newline
print("First line\nSecond line")

# Tab
print("Name:\tAlice")
print("Age:\t25")

# Backslash itself
print("This is a backslash: \\")

# Quote inside quote
print("She said, \"Hello!\"")
```

## Raw Strings

Use `r` prefix for raw strings (backslashes treated literally):

```{python}
# Regular string
print("C:\new\test")  # \n and \t are special characters

# Raw string
print(r"C:\new\test")  # Exactly as typed
```

Raw strings are useful for file paths and regular expressions!

## Making Programs Interactive (Preview)

We can make programs interactive with `input()`:

```{python}
#| eval: false
name = input("What's your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}! Nice to meet you!")

age = input("How old are you? ")
print(f"Wow, {age} is a great age!")
```

We'll learn more about `input()` in the next chapter!

## Code Structure and Style

Good Python code follows conventions:

### Naming Conventions

```{python}
# Variables: lowercase with underscores
user_name = "Alice"
user_age = 25

# Constants: UPPERCASE
PI = 3.14159
MAX_SIZE = 100

# We'll learn about functions and classes later
```

### Indentation

Python uses indentation to define code blocks (more on this later):

```python
# Correct
if True:
    print("Indented")
    print("Still indented")

# Wrong - will cause error
if True:
print("Not indented")  # IndentationError!
```

:::{.callout-important}
## Indentation Rules

- Use 4 spaces per indentation level
- Don't mix tabs and spaces
- Be consistent throughout your code
- Most editors can be set to insert 4 spaces when you press Tab
:::

### Line Length

Try to keep lines under 79-80 characters:

```python
# Too long
result = some_function(argument1, argument2, argument3, argument4, argument5, argument6)

# Better - break into multiple lines
result = some_function(
    argument1, argument2, argument3,
    argument4, argument5, argument6
)
```

## Common Beginner Mistakes

### 1. Forgetting Quotes

```python
# Wrong
print(Hello)  # NameError: name 'Hello' is not defined

# Correct
print("Hello")
```

### 2. Mismatched Quotes

```python
# Wrong
print("Hello')  # SyntaxError

# Correct
print("Hello")
```

### 3. Missing Parentheses

```python
# Wrong in Python 3
print "Hello"  # SyntaxError

# Correct
print("Hello")
```

### 4. Case Sensitivity

```python
# Wrong
Print("Hello")  # NameError: name 'Print' is not defined

# Correct
print("Hello")  # Python is case-sensitive!
```

## Running Python Programs

### From Command Line

```bash
# Save your code in a file: hello.py
# Then run it:
python hello.py
# or
python3 hello.py
```

### From VS Code

1. Open your `.py` file
2. Click the Run button (▶️) in the top-right
3. Or press F5 for debug mode
4. Or right-click and select "Run Python File in Terminal"

### From IDLE

1. File → New File
2. Write your code
3. File → Save (save as `.py`)
4. Run → Run Module (or press F5)

## Your First Project: Personal Introduction

Let's create a complete program that introduces you:

```{python}
# Personal Introduction Program

# Header
print("*" * 50)
print("PERSONAL INTRODUCTION".center(50))
print("*" * 50)

# Information
name = "Your Name"
age = 25
hobby = "Python programming"
favorite_color = "blue"
favorite_number = 7

# Introduction
print(f"\nHello! My name is {name}.")
print(f"I am {age} years old.")
print(f"I love {hobby}!")
print(f"My favorite color is {favorite_color}.")
print(f"My favorite number is {favorite_number}.")

# Fun calculations
print(f"\nFun Facts:")
print(f"- In dog years, I'd be {age * 7} years old!")
print(f"- My age times my favorite number is {age * favorite_number}")
print(f"- The sum of my age digits is {sum(int(d) for d in str(age))}")

# Closing
print("\n" + "*" * 50)
print("Thanks for getting to know me!".center(50))
print("*" * 50)
```
