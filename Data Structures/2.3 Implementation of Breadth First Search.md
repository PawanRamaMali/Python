## Implementation of Breadth First Search

An alternative algorithm called Breath-First search provides us with the ability to return the same results as DFS but with the added guarantee to return the shortest-path first. This algorithm is a little more tricky to implement in a recursive manner instead using the queue data-structure, as such I will only being documenting the iterative approach. The actions performed per each explored vertex are the same as the depth-first implementation, however, replacing the stack with a queue will instead explore the breadth of a vertex depth before moving on. This behavior guarantees that the first path located is one of the shortest-paths present, based on number of edges being the cost factor.
