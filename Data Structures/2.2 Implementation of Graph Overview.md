## Implementation of Graph Overview

In this lecture we will implement a simple graph by focusing on the Node class. 


The graph will be directed and the edges can hold weights.

We will have three classes, a State class, a Node class, and finally the Graph class.

We're going to be taking advantage of two built-in tools here, OrderDict and Enum

```py
from enum import Enum  

class State(Enum):
    unvisited = 1 #White
    visited = 2 #Black
    visiting = 3 #Gray
```


Now for the Node class we will take advantage of the OrderedDict object in case we want to keep trak of the order keys are added to the dictionary.

 ```py
from collections import OrderedDict

class Node:

    def __init__(self, num):
        self.num = num
        self.visit_state = State.unvisited
        self.adjacent = OrderedDict()  # key = node, val = weight

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.num)
```
