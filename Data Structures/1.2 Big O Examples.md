# Big O Examples

In the first part of the Big-O example section we will go through various iterations of the various Big-O functions. Make sure to complete the reading assignment!

Let's begin with some simple examples and explore what their Big-O is.

## O(1) Constant

```py
def func_constant(values):
    '''
    Prints first item in a list of values.
    '''
    print values[0]
    
func_constant([1,2,3])
```
Note how this function is constant because regardless of the list size, the function will only ever take a constant step size, in this case 1, printing the first value from a list. so we can see here that an input list of 100 values will print just 1 item, a list of 10,000 values will print just 1 item, and a list of n values will print just 1 item!

## O(n) Linear

```py
def func_lin(lst):
    '''
    Takes in list and prints out all values
    '''
    for val in lst:
        print val
        
func_lin([1,2,3])
```
This function runs in O(n) (linear time). This means that the number of operations taking place scales linearly with n, so we can see here that an input list of 100 values will print 100 times, a list of 10,000 values will print 10,000 times, and a list of n values will print n times.


## O(n^2) Quadratic

```py
def func_quad(lst):
    '''
    Prints pairs for every item in list.
    '''
    for item_1 in lst:
        for item_2 in lst:
            print item_1,item_2
            
lst = [0, 1, 2, 3]

func_quad(lst)
```

Note how we now have two loops, one nested inside another. This means that for a list of n items, we will have to perform n operations for every item in the list! This means in total, we will perform n times n assignments, or n^2. So a list of 10 items will have 10^2, or 100 operations. You can see how dangerous this can get for very large inputs! This is why Big-O is so important to be aware of!
