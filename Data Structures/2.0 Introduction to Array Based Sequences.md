## Introduction to Array Based Sequences

In this lecture, we will get a brief overview of the "sequence" type object classes available in Python. These are mainly the list,tuple, and string objects. The main commonaility between these object types is the ability to index to access individual elements in the sequence. For example:
```py
l = [1,2,3]
l[0]
```
1
```py
t = (1,2,3)
t[0]
```
1
```py
s = '123'
s[0]
```
'1'
