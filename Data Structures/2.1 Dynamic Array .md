## Dynamic Array 

In this exercise we will create our own Dynamic Array class!

We'll be using a built in library called ctypes. Check out the documentation for more info, but its basically going to be used here as a raw array from the ctypes module. If you find yourself very interested in it, check out: Ctypes Tutorial

Also...

A quick note on public vs private methods, we can use an underscore _ before the method name to keep it non-public. For example:
```py
class M(object):
    
    def public(self):
        print 'Use Tab to see me!'
        
    def _private(self):
        print "You won't be able to Tab to see me!"
m = M()
m.public()
m._private()
```
Use Tab to see me!
You won't be able to see me!
