# Big O Notation

In this lecture we will go over how the syntax of Big-O Notation works and how we can describe algorithms using Big-O Notation!

We previously discussed the functions below:
```py
# First function (Note the use of xrange since this is in Python 2)
def sum1(n):
    '''
    Take an input of n and return the sum of the numbers from 0 to n
    '''
    final_sum = 0
    for x in xrange(n+1): 
        final_sum += x
    
    return final_sum
```
```py
def sum2(n):
    """
    Take an input of n and return the sum of the numbers from 0 to n
    """
    return (n*(n+1))/2
    
```
